# map-my-escape

## Inspiration

We wanted to find a way to keep our communities up-to-date on what is going on in their environment in a fast and efficient way.

## What it does

Users sign up on our website by giving us their phone numbers. They will then receive a text message asking the user to send their location so that our program can personalize its alerts to the area they live in. Also we use cohere to summarize the alerts for them.

## Try it out

- Map my Escape is not deployed yet, but you can try it out by cloning the repo and running the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You will also need: 
- A Twilio account
- A mongodb remote server with a database called "map-my-escape" and a collection called "users"
- A cohere account

Copy the env example file and fill in the required fields

## Challenges we ran into

One challenging problem we ran into was getting all three of the APIs to work together to make a functional web app. Another challenge was getting the Wix front end to connect the backend. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting more familiarized with using version control in a team environment and overcoming the challenges we ran into.

## What we learned

Going forward we feel like this project has lots of potential to become a useful tool within our communities and we would like to explore that as a team.
